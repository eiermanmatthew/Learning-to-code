Learning to Code - Guide - Lessons - Advice
After spending years in startups and around technology, I finally started to formally learn to code. 
I've done some front end development, product/project management, and learned html/css/basic in high school. But never sat down to learn to code. I've learned alot up to this point about operations, logistics, finance, project/product management, erp systems, leadership development and specific software applications.

This will be my formal education, and I'm using a a few courses and advisors to help along the way.
I've built a curriculum based on other programs. 
This will be a record of my progress into coding.
